# Get-familiar-with-a-book-without-reading-it

short and simple notebook which demonstrates the creation of a graph which visualizes the connections network between the main places and people in a book

I use the following tools:<br>
1. spaCy - An NLP (natural language processing) package, to perform NER (named entity recognition).
2. NetwrokX - A package for the creation and manipulation of complex networks.
3. [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) - An external software, used to visualize the graph.

I create the graph of the book ["The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/76/76-0.txt), by Mark Twain.
